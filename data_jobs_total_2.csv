Our web stack is Ruby on Rails for the backend and React/React-native for the clients, and we interact with Data through SQL on AWS, but it‚Äôs not mandatory to be proficient in those (most of the team came with other areas of expertise which is very enriching). We believe that someone who has good aptitudes and is hungry for learning is what works best.

You are a learner: You want to improve your skills not only in the engineering field but across any other areas. You are an owner: You like proposing new hypotheses and be responsible for building, deploying and validating them. You love understanding: Breaking down complex problems into basic and shareable elements and you have evolved concrete implementations to abstractions before. You are a polyglot developer: You have experience in several coding languages, CI/CD tools and cloud technologies. You are a mentor: You love to share your experience and expertise to help others grow. You are comfortable communicating in English.

At Factorial we don't evaluate you by the years of experience you have, we evaluate your knowledge and skills. How are we doing it? We have a Career Path with a rubric framework where we define what is expected for each experience level and skill we're evaluating. This framework will allow you to know at which level you're right now and what do you need to continue growing in the company.
As we love transparency (it's one of our hiring values), our Career Path includes the salaries for each level and we share it during the first interview to make sure we're aligned.
